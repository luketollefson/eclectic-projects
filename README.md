Some eclectic programming projects. Languages include C, Clojure, Haskell, Java, and Scheme.

Also includes some practice for the Ed and Vi editor.

Books I walked through (either partially or entirely) include:

* *The C Programming Language* by K&R
* *Getting Clojure: Build Your Functional Skills One Idea at a Time* by Russ Olsen
* *A Tutorial Introduction to the UNIX Text Editor* by Brian W. Kernighan
* *Haskell Programming from First Principles* by Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki **Best overall Haskell book**
* *Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!* by Miran Lipovaca
* *Programming in Haskell* by Graham Hutton **Best Haskell book for rapid conceptual understanding*
* *Java Illuminated* by Julie Anderson and Harve J. Franceschi (Book used by Computer Science I at NDSU) 
* *The Little Schemer* by Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen **Excellent!**
* *Structure and Interpretations of Computer Programs* by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, Julie Sussman (Best CS book written IMO)
* *Learning the vi Editor* by Arnold Robbins and Linda Lamb
