The most common examples of logic error are ones where
the programmer is off by one. It is easy to make this
error because length of a string is different than the
index of the last character of the string. Other errors
can be made if the programmer forgets to properly prime
an loop, or if the sentinel of a loop is processed.

One can see if they have an infite loop in thier code
if the condition to terminae the loop does not get
closer with every iteration. If the variables in the
condition, as well as the rest of the program state, don't
change from one interation of the the loop to the next
the loop will be indefinite.
