The Java compiler is very helpful in determining what
syntax errors I have in my code. It is best used by making
a small correction and recompiling to see if an error dissapears.
Often one small change can fix many errors at once. It is
one of the more helpful compilers I have used.

OOP allows the programmer to encapsulate data and methods
into one package. If the programmer wants to reuse the
code, all they have to do is import it, and wallah, it's
usable. OOP has incresed the resuablity, and therefore
readablity of code.

If you needed a user to enter a mixture of words and numebers,
say "6 plums, 4 apples, 12 peaches". The string could be cut up
into number and fruit pairs, and the parseInt method would let
you convert the string "6", or "4", or "12", into an integer.
The integer could then be used in opperations such as addition.

Having a large standardised library allows the programmer to
quickly write programs. By using the library they are not
reinventing the wheel, nor do they have to care about how the
methods in say Math are implemented. It also means another
programmer can look at the code and understand it easier,
as long as they are familier with the standard library.
