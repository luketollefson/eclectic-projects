Local area networks (LANs) have a number of advantages over
stanalone computer systems. For one, it is a more scalable
approch to adding more users to a system. Rather than having
a ceterilzed computer, one which could fail, and therefore
all users are unable to use the computer. If everyone has thier
own computers, then they can do their own work locally, independent
of the state of the the centerizlied (mainframe) computer
system. Upgrades to the system involes upgrading each computer
individually, which enables the users to upgrade when they
need, independet of the needs of other users.

speed when compared to PC # 2, but only has a forth of the
ram. Considering most users today will need at least 4 GB
of ram, the lower clock speed is not so imporant. Clock speed
also has very little to do with real world performance, the
only thing the higher clock speed will gaurntee to do is
drain more power.
