The fact that the number of coulums can be different
in every row is advantagous in severl situations.
For instance, a text file's words (like this one)
would be broken into a String[][] type, where
each row represents a line. Since each line
doesn't have the same number of words. The flexabily
makes sense here. More often then not however, one
will use a two dimential array (an array of arrays)
as a table, where each element has meaningful data.
If the number of columns of a table were fixed, it
could potentially eliminate some sytanx that is there
to ensure one doesn't get a runtime exception. There
are places for both variable column, and fixed column
2d arrays, but in general one will used the fixed
column version

ArrayLists have many benifits. One can remove and add
new elements to the array. It isn't often that one will
know the size of an array before hand, and it will likely
need to expand during the program evaulation. Another benifit
of ArrayLists is the enhanced for loop syntax for them. One
has to wonder why Java doesn't allow this syntax for
ordinary arrays. The drawbacks of ArrayLists, and where
ordinary arrays have the advantage is performacne. ArrayLists
have addiontal overhead that ensure that they will be able
to fit the elements you add to the list.
