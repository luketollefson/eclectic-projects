Inheritance would allow another programmer to extend existing
code in a modular way. If thier collugue had designed a class
which was well tested and documented (and therefore reusuable),
then the other programrammer could confidently inherit from
that class, and extend the functinality of the program. The
availiablity of inheritance also allows programmers to abtract
common patterns several layers deep. The abstraction allows 
programmers to use polymorphism and create code that operates
on a varity of objects that are derived from some higher class.

Dependency hell is the program you get (or diamond dependency)
		
		A
	  /	  \
	B		C
	  \   /
		D

In this model, B and C inhit from A, and D inherits form B and C.
Lets say all classes start at version 1.0. Now, if A updates to 2.0, can
we nessarily immidaitly implement it? No, it could break B or C, and if
it doesn't, it could break D. Lets say it breaks B, so we update B to 2.0
to work with A, unfortuantly we cant update anyting still, D would still
be broken under our model. So then we have to go and fix D, and finally
we can update all of the classes. Also, if B and C have the same method,
which one does D inherit?
