Ints take up 32 bits of memory, shorts take up 16 bits of memory,
and longs take up 64 bits of memory. Ints are standard to use
in most cases, and don't put up much of a fuss. The memory saves of
shorts is really only noticable if one has a lot of them, more than
just a few variables. Longs are not used too often, as ints are
servicable for most things. But if one needs to keep track of say,
number of views on a video, or the population of continents, longs
are handy.
