It a class is not documented at all, the only way a programmer will
be able to know what the functions do and the purpose of the class
is by infering by the name of the variables and methods. If there is
some documentation the code is far easier to reuse because the explanations
can provide signficant clarity.

It is very important to follow the naming conventions. It means the
programmer can follow the code, and nothing too undexpeted will happen.
If the conventions were not followed the programmers would have no
idea wether a word is a class or a variable or method.
