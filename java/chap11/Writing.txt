Exceptions allow the program to deal with
situtations that would normally break the program.
Say, if the user enters data, if the data is not
an expected format, and exception can be raised.

Issues with exceptions raise when one starts nesting
try{} catch{} statements, it can become complicated
in a hurry. Also, if one designes the program to
"march-on" during runtime exceptions, it makes the
program more complicated, as there are more possible
states for it to be in.

It is important to keep ones code well documented.
When reading a file with objects inside it, understanding
what the objects mean, and how to use them is 
vital to reusablity.
